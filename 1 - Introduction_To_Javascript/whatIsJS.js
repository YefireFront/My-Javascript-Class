// JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It is a versatile language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages. JavaScript can run in the browser, allowing for client-side interactivity, and on the server side using environments like Node.js.

// Key features of JavaScript:

// Event-driven: JavaScript can respond to user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and more.
// Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of objects and classes.
// Dynamic typing: Variables in JavaScript do not require a declared type and can change type dynamically.
// Prototype-based: In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through prototypes rather than classical inheritance models.
